# Weight Converter

This is a simple weight converter Python program that allows the user to convert weights between pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kg). The program takes the user's input for weight and unit (either `lbs` or `kg`) and outputs the converted weight in the opposite unit.

## How to Use

1. The program prompts the user to enter a weight amount.
2. Then, the user is asked to input the unit of the weight (`lbs` for pounds or `kg` for kilograms).
3. Based on the unit provided, the program converts the weight to the other unit and displays the result.

### Example:

- If you input `150` and `lbs`, the program will convert the weight to kilograms.
- If you input `68` and `kg`, the program will convert the weight to pounds.

### Instructions:

1. **Start the Program**: Simply run the Python script.
2. **Enter Weight**: Input the weight you want to convert.
3. **Enter Unit**: Choose either `lbs` or `kg` as the unit of the weight.
4. **Get the Result**: The program will display the converted weight in the opposite unit.
